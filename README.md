## Installation

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
It's nice to have an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Clone the project:
Open the command terminal and type:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dekopossas/staff-management.git
```
or access this [link](git@github.com:dekopossas/staff-management.git) and download the zip.

### ðŸŽ² Running the Back End (server)
The focus of the project was to demonstrate my skills with the frontend, so I used the backend that I consider as simple as possible and easy to do, Json Server.
In the project folder, open your terminal and follow the step by step:

```bash
# Access the backend project directory:
$ cd backend

# Install dependencies:
$ yarn

# Start the Backend with the command:
$ yarn start
```
### The server will start on port:3001 -

### ðŸŽ² Running the Front End (site)
In a new terminal in the project's local folder follow this step by step:

```bash
# Access the frontend project directory:
$ cd frontend

# Install dependencies:
$ yarn

# Start the Backend with the command:
$ yarn start
```
Wait until the browser opens on port 3000

If you are using the npm package, the commands are different,
I recommend following the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/)
